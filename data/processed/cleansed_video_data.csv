Mozzarella is traditionally made using rennet. However in this video we are going to see making mozzarella using rennet as well as making mozzarella using vinegar. The most important thing in making mozzarella is the selection of milk. The best milk is the milk fresh from farmers which has not been pasteurized or homogenized. The next best choice is using non-homogenized but pasteurized milk. The worst case is using homogenized and ultra-pasteurized milk (which makes very hard curds leading to paneer). The difference is also evident when melting these cheeses, the rennet made cheese melts at low temperatures and is very stretchy, the vinegar made cheese (+non-homogenized milk) does melt but takes a little longer and at a higher temperature however when homogenized milk is used in combination with vinegar it makes paneer.

"w7TovPbaiBM","Chicken Roll Recipe in Tamil | Chicken Bread Roll Recipe | Chicken Kheema Bread Roll","In this video we will see how to make Chicken bread roll recipe in Tamil. This bread roll is a quick and easy snack in which bread is rolled into a thin sheet and well seasoned chicken pieces along with onions is stuffed inside this bread pocket. After frying the bread develops this golden brown crunchy texture. The chicken stuffing can be replaced with the stuffing of your choice from vegetables, paneer, egg or meat. Serve these hot bread rolls with some ketchup or chutney. For mincing the chicken, I have used a knife to chop it into small pieces instead of using a electric food processor because I like some texture in the bread roll. But the choice of mincing is your call.  Tips to prevent excess oil absorption. 1) Roll the bread into thin layer this will close out the air pockets in the bread and prevent oil from seeping inside. 2) The oil temperature should be medium high. If the temperature is too low then the bread will soak up too much oil. If its too high then the outer surface will get burnt very quickly. 3) Don't fry too many pieces at once.

Molten chocolate lava cake is one of the ultimate dessert recipes. The soft and fluffy cake at the exterior and warm and smooth chocolaty center is an absolute delight to enjoy.

Mysore pak is an indian sweet recipe enjoyed during the festival season. In this version of mysore pak, we are going to make it hard and crispy while retaining a porous structure. This is in fact a hybrid between the soft ghee mysore pak and the hard version of mysore pak. In this recipe I have used a 1:1 ghee to oil ratio but you can make it with 1.5 cups of ghee and 0.5 cup of oil or completely ommit the oil. Keep adding the hot oil/ghee mixture as long as the flour can absorb it. Once the flour starts oozing out the absorbed oil/ghee its time to stop adding and we are at the end of the recipe. For a perfect mysore pak use the following tips, 1) Increase the temperature of the mixture to high and make it bubbly before poring the mixture in a tray. 2) Do not press the surface of the mysore pak after pouring it in the tray. This will collapse some air pockets. 3) Use a deep tray for setting, preferably over 3 inches. The depth causes the mysore pak to cool slowly in the middle leading to a reddish layer in the middle of the mysore pak. 4) Cut and make grooves before the mysore pak completely solidifes.

This is the biryani masala powder that gives the wonderful smell and flavor to biryani. Apart from biryani this garam masala powder is used any many recipes from the Indian cuisine. I like to make small batches like the one shown in the video because the flavor and smell will deteriorate with time and so we don't want to make a huge batch of masala powder. Also I have used less coriander powder in this recipe because using too much coriander powder will impart a bitter taste to the recipe. So depending on the recipe, we can add coriander powder or coriander seeds separately. The same goes for chilli powder, that also needs to be added according to the taste preferences. So finally this is a flavor pack of super aromatic spices and this garam masala can transform any ordinary dish into a restaurant quality food.

"8GZTCNzyMQM","Dosa Batter Recipe in Tamil | Idli Dosa maavu in Tamil | How to make Dosa batter at home","In this video we will see how to make dosa batter at home. Idli batter / Dosa batter is very easy to make once the ratio of rice and urad dal(ulunthu) is established. Usually for perfect dosas we use 1 : 4 (1 cup of ulunthu for 4 cups of rice) however this ratio depends on the type of rice being used. If the grains of rice are fatter (more starch content ) then this ratio would work. If the rice grains are thinner you can try 1:3 ratio (1 cup of ulunthu for 3 cups of rice). Once a ratio is finalized for a particular brand of rice we can get perfect results after that.  For making idlis, the batter should not be fermented much so I usually make idlis during the first 2 days of making the batter. On day 3 the batter would have fermented sufficiently for making crispy dosas. Nonstick pans are easier to spread the dosa batter but the real taste and caramelized color of dosa can be achieved only in cast iron pans. Friends now we can enjoy soft and spongy idlis and crispy dosas all made from our homemade batter. So instead of buying the dosa batter from stores we can make them right from home.

The most  important part of making the batter is grinding it without adding much water. We need to get a fluffy batter consistency which creates a much lighter, airy vada.

Ghee ( Nei in Tamil) is added in sweets because it has a nutty flavor and this is introduced by the slow heat applied to butter.

Some people might stop the process early but this results in a less flavorful version of ghee so please continue the cooking until you get a good color. There will be some sediments formed at the bottom of the pan. They are the remains of caramelization and they can be removed in the filtration step. Now our butter is clarified a.k.a Ghee. Homemade ghee is more flavorful than store bought ones because we can heat it longer and develop much stronger flavor while in stores they will try to sell at maximum possible volume. Ghee can be stored at room temperature.   The flavoring of ghee can be done by adding some curry leaves or murungai keerai. Both of them add a nice aroma to our homemade ghee.

"KHj9-sAmDVQ","Vatha Kuzhambu / Vatha Kulambu in Tamil / Sundakkai Vathal Kuzhambu / சுண்ட வத்தல் குழம்பு","Vatha Kuzhambu / Vatha Kulambu is a popular gravy for rice served all over South India in a traditional meal setting. The Vatha Kuzhambu is made from Sundakkai Vathal which is called as Turkey Berry in other parts of the world. The addition of this sundakkai vathal adds a unique tangy taste to the Sundakkai Vathal Kulambu. This kulambu is often served in meals right after paruppu kulambu before the round for sambar rice.  Vatha Kulambu is also called Vathal Puli Kulambu because the tamarind extract(puli) is slowly simmered over a low flame and in the mean time the gravy extracts the flavors from the added vathal. Thus we end up with a concentrated tasty gravy for our rice. I have used sundakkai for my vatha kulambu but you can use other types of vathal such as manathakkali vathal, vendakkai vathal, milagu vathal etc. Each of these ingredients will add a unique taste to the kulambu. Sundakkai also has a lot of health and medicinal benefits and therefore makes this recipe healthier.
