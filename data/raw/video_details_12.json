Gasket is also not needed.\n4) Heat the cooker on medium high heat for 10 mins\n5) Arrange the folded puffs on a small stainless steel saucer.\n5) Open the pressure cooker and lower the saucer into the cooker and place it on the wire rack / metal stand.\n    \nThe saucer which has the puffs SHOULD NOT directly touch the salt layer. It should rest on the elevated metal stand. If it comes into contact with the direct heat it will be burnt.\n\n6) Reduce the heat to medium and cover the pressure cooker lid.Gasket is also not needed.\n7) Check after 20 minutes.\n8) Once the puffs are golden brown they are ready to take out.\n9) Continue steps 5-8 for the remaining batches of puffs.\n\nFriends, please do try this easy puff recipe at home and share it with your friends and family.

This is a cake made with maida flour which is then fried in hot oil. This is a popular snack in many tea stalls and I used to buy them and enjoy this street food snack. \nThe oil temperature is very critical in this recipe. If the oil is too hot, the kajada will get burnt on the surface before the inside is fully cooked. If the oil temperature is too low then the kajada will soak up a lot of oil. Maintain a moderate temperature during the entire frying period.\n\nFriends, please do try this tea kadai kajada at home. This is quick and easy evening snack. Everyone would be surprised that you made this street food snack right at home. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below.

This is a cake made with maida flour which is then fried in hot oil. This is a popular snack in many tea stalls and I used to buy them and enjoy this street food snack. \nThe oil temperature is very critical in this recipe. If the oil is too hot, the kajada will get burnt on the surface before the inside is fully cooked. If the oil temperature is too low then the kajada will soak up a lot of oil. Maintain a moderate temperature during the entire frying period.\n\nFriends, please do try this tea kadai kajada at home. This is quick and easy evening snack. Everyone would be surprised that you made this street food snack right at home. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below. All the best and happy cooking!\n\nFor detailed kajada recipe along with the list of ingredients please visit\nhttps://www.steffisrecipes.com/2019/11/tea-kadali-kajada.html"

During this onam festive season lets make this traditional sweet recipe and enjoy it. To make this recipe we need adai which is sold in stores, I personally like the \"Kuthuvilakku\" brand of adai because even after cooking, the adai will retain some texture. Also cooking this recipe in coconut milk adds an unique taste and mouthfeel to the recipe. I have added small chips of coconut in this recipe because they add some crunch to the payasam and nice contrasts the soft adai.\n\nFriends please do try this recipe at home and wish you a happy Onam.  Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below.

During this onam festive season lets make this traditional sweet recipe and enjoy it. To make this recipe we need adai which is sold in stores, I personally like the \"Kuthuvilakku\" brand of adai because even after cooking, the adai will retain some texture. Also cooking this recipe in coconut milk adds an unique taste and mouthfeel to the recipe. I have added small chips of coconut in this recipe because they add some crunch to the payasam and nice contrasts the soft adai.\n\nFriends please do try this recipe at home and wish you a happy Onam.  Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below. All the best and happy cooking !\n\nFor detailed adai payasam recipe along with the list of ingredients please visit\nhttps://www.steffisrecipes.com/2019/09/ada-payasam-recipe.html"
