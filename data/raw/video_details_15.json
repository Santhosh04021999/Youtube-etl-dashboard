                "description": "In this video we will see how to make Palak Paneer Recipe in Tamil. Palak paneer (Keerai Paneer) is one of the many paneer gravy recipes which pair excellent as a side dish / gravy for chapathi or naan. This recipe is so flavorful that even people who usually don't like spinach will still enjoy this gravy. Spinach cooks very fast and we only want to soak the spinach leaves for a very short time in hot water. This blanching process softens the leaves and helps in making a fine paste. The perfect palak paneer should have this bright green colour to it, if you cook the spinach leaves too much or if you caramelize the onions too much then the colour will darken.\nFriends, please do try this palak paneer recipe at home and amaze your friends and family with this tasty keerai recipe. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below. All the best and happy cooking !!\n\nFor detailed palak paneer recipe please visit\nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/2017/11/palak-paneer-recipe.html",

                "description": "In this video we will see how to make Mysore Pak recipe in Tamil. Mysore pak is an indian sweet recipe enjoyed during the festival season. In this version of mysore pak, we are going to make it hard and crispy while retaining a porous structure. This is in fact a hybrid between the soft ghee mysore pak and the hard version of mysore pak. In this recipe I have used a 1:1 ghee to oil ratio but you can make it with 1.5 cups of ghee and 0.5 cup of oil or completely ommit the oil. Keep adding the hot oil/ghee mixture as long as the flour can absorb it. Once the flour starts oozing out the absorbed oil/ghee its time to stop adding and we are at the end of the recipe. For a perfect mysore pak use the following tips,\n1) Increase the temperature of the mixture to high and make it bubbly before poring the mixture in a tray.\n2) Do not press the surface of the mysore pak after pouring it in the tray. This will collapse some air pockets.\n3) Use a deep tray for setting, preferably over 3 inches. The depth causes the mysore pak to cool slowly in the middle leading to a reddish layer in the middle of the mysore pak.\n4) Cut and make grooves before the mysore pak completely solidifes.\n\nFriends, please do try this mysore pake recipe at home and share it with your friends and family during the holidays. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below. All the best and happy cooking.\n\nFor detailed Mysore Pak Recipe please visit\nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/2017/10/mysore-pak-recipe-hard-mysorepak-recipe.html",

                    "description": "In this video we will see how to make Mysore Pak recipe in Tamil. Mysore pak is an indian sweet recipe enjoyed during the festival season. In this version of mysore pak, we are going to make it hard and crispy while retaining a porous structure. This is in fact a hybrid between the soft ghee mysore pak and the hard version of mysore pak. In this recipe I have used a 1:1 ghee to oil ratio but you can make it with 1.5 cups of ghee and 0.5 cup of oil or completely ommit the oil. Keep adding the hot oil/ghee mixture as long as the flour can absorb it. Once the flour starts oozing out the absorbed oil/ghee its time to stop adding and we are at the end of the recipe. For a perfect mysore pak use the following tips,\n1) Increase the temperature of the mixture to high and make it bubbly before poring the mixture in a tray.\n2) Do not press the surface of the mysore pak after pouring it in the tray. This will collapse some air pockets.\n3) Use a deep tray for setting, preferably over 3 inches. The depth causes the mysore pak to cool slowly in the middle leading to a reddish layer in the middle of the mysore pak.\n4) Cut and make grooves before the mysore pak completely solidifes.\n\nFriends, please do try this mysore pake recipe at home and share it with your friends and family during the holidays. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below. All the best and happy cooking.\n\nFor detailed Mysore Pak Recipe please visit\nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/2017/10/mysore-pak-recipe-hard-mysorepak-recipe.html"

This homemade ice cream only requires 3 ingredients, Heavy whipping cream, condensed milk and flavoring of your choice. In this ice cream recipe, I have flavored the ice cream using pureed fruits (mango ice cream, strawberry ice cream and banana ice cream). I also like a little crunch in my ice cream so I have added some caramelized nuts and they are crispy. If you cannot get cream near your location, I have already uploaded two other ice cream recipes without using cream (the recipe links are at the end of the video), you can follow those methods for making ice cream.\n\nFriends, please do try these flavors / varieties of ice cream at home. You can also experiment with more flavors and ideas. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below. All the best and happy cooking !!\n\nFor detailed ice cream recipe please visit\nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/2017/10/3-ingredient-ice-cream.html"

The dry version can be used as an appetizer while the manchurian gravy can be served with naan / chapathi or rice. We can use any veggies of our choice and these are held together by maida and corn starch. Make sure that you don't add excess water. Usually the residual water from the veggies will be sufficient so just sprinkle water until the mixture begins to hold its shape. If you notice the manchurian balls disintegrating in the oil, then you can add additional maida / all purpose flour and it will bind everything together. Also fry them over a medium heat.\n\nFriends, please do try this delicious Veg Manchurian gravy at home. This is a very delicious way to enjoy the vegetables and also it will be a very different gravy to enjoy with your friends and family. Please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below.

This is the Sweet modak recipe / Pooranam Kolukattai recipe version in which we are going to make a filling with jaggery and coconut and make the casing out of rice flour. This in an amazing sweet served during festival of Vinayagar Chaturthi.\n\nINGREDIENTS :-\nRice flour             --- 1 CUP\nBOILING Water   ---  1 CUP\nCoconut               --- 2 CUPS (can add 1+1 cup of boiled daal)\nJaggery                --- 1 CUP\nGhee                     --- 2 TBSP\nSalt to taste\n\nSome tips to make soft kozhukattai,\n1) Make sure the water is boiling hot when adding to the rice flour.\n2) Start making the shells immediately when the flour reaches a workable heat level.\n3)Do not heat the jaggery mixture beyond the point of dissolving. If it reaches a string stage then the centre of kozhukattai will be hard.\n4) Do not let the flour cool completely before placing it in the steamer. Cover it with a damp cloth to retain the heat and moisture. If the flour cools completely the kozhukattai's will turn rubbery upon cooling.\n\nFriends please do try this easy kozhukattai recipe at home and share it with your family and friends and enjoy the holidays.

This is the Sweet modak recipe / Pooranam Kolukattai recipe version in which we are going to make a filling with jaggery and coconut and make the casing out of rice flour. This in an amazing sweet served during festival of Vinayagar Chaturthi.\n\nINGREDIENTS :-\nRice flour             --- 1 CUP\nBOILING Water   ---  1 CUP\nCoconut               --- 2 CUPS (can add 1+1 cup of boiled daal)\nJaggery                --- 1 CUP\nGhee                     --- 2 TBSP\nSalt to taste\n\nSome tips to make soft kozhukattai,\n1) Make sure the water is boiling hot when adding to the rice flour.\n2) Start making the shells immediately when the flour reaches a workable heat level.\n3)Do not heat the jaggery mixture beyond the point of dissolving. If it reaches a string stage then the centre of kozhukattai will be hard.\n4) Do not let the flour cool completely before placing it in the steamer. Cover it with a damp cloth to retain the heat and moisture. If the flour cools completely the kozhukattai's will turn rubbery upon cooling.\n\nFriends please do try this easy kozhukattai recipe at home and share it with your family and friends and enjoy the holidays.

One major problem beginners face when making this adhirasam is that it often disintegrates in oil. In order to get perfect adhirasam we have to choose the right rice type and the correct consistency of the batter. The next step is the temperature of the oil. Once you get these conditions right you will realize that making adhirasam is not that difficult. Nowadays we can get this sweet at shops but it is often stale and nothing can come close to the taste of fresh homemade adhirasam.\n\nFriends please do try this recipe at home and share this traditional festival sweet with your friends and family.

One major problem beginners face when making this adhirasam is that it often disintegrates in oil. In order to get perfect adhirasam we have to choose the right rice type and the correct consistency of the batter. The next step is the temperature of the oil. Once you get these conditions right you will realize that making adhirasam is not that difficult. Nowadays we can get this sweet at shops but it is often stale and nothing can come close to the taste of fresh homemade adhirasam.\n\nFriends please do try this recipe at home and share this traditional festival sweet with your friends and family.

This murukku is very easy to make and is an excellent evening snack. The softness of the murukku is dictated by the urad dal. I have used the ratio of 1:4 for urad dal to rice flour. If you prefer a softer murukku you can use more of urad dal, 1 cup of urad dal for 3 cups of rice flour and if you prefer a harder murukku, you can use the ingredients in the ratio of 1:5. Cumin seeds and asafoetida are used for flavoring the murukku.\n\nFriends please do try this murukku recipe at home and surprise your friends and family with this awesome snack.

                    "description": "In this video we will see how to make murukku at home in Tamil. This murukku recipe is the \" Thenkuzhal Murukku \" variety. This murukku is very easy to make and is an excellent evening snack. The softness of the murukku is dictated by the urad dal. I have used the ratio of 1:4 for urad dal to rice flour. If you prefer a softer murukku you can use more of urad dal, 1 cup of urad dal for 3 cups of rice flour and if you prefer a harder murukku, you can use the ingredients in the ratio of 1:5. Cumin seeds and asafoetida are used for flavoring the murukku.\n\nFriends please do try this murukku recipe at home and surprise your friends and family with this awesome snack. Also please do share your feedback after trying the recipe in the comments below. All the best and happy cooking.\n\nFor more such recipes please visit\nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/"

This instant rava idli batter does not need fermenting and can be prepared in under 20 minutes. So this is ideal when we don't have batter in the idli house. I have added some carrots , onions and green chilli and tempering for flavoring the idli. Also this tastes very different than the traditional idli and everyone will love this change. The rava idli batter should be a little thick this will make sure that the idlis have a nice shape and texture to them. Serve the idlis with coconut chutney.\n\nFriends, please do try this different and delicious rava idli at home. I am sure everyone will appreciate the change in menu. Also please share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below.
