I have made this recipe using cashew nuts but a mixture of cashewnut and peanut or using almonds instead of cashews will work as well. There are two important grinding steps, the first grinding is the sugar and cocoa powder, these need to be as fine as possible. This will create the smooth finish of nutella, the next grinding is that of the roasted cashew nuts, in this case we want to grind in pulses till the oil oozes out from the cashews and it has turned into a paste. If we rush through any of these steps the final product will have a gritty texture. Scrape the sides of the mixer and grind it in pulses for about 20 times.\n#nutella #HomemadeNutella #NutellaRecipe\n\nI have used unsweetened dutch processed cocoa in this recipe, this creates a mellow taste and has a dark color. Homemade nutella can easily prepared at fraction of the cost and if cocoa powder is not available, we can use 100g of bar chocolate as an alternative.\n\nFriends, please do try this nutella recipe at home and this chocolate spread will be great on bread and will taste absolutely amazing. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below. All the best and happy cooking!",

                    "description": "In this video we will see how to make nutella recipe in tamil. This homemade nutella is going to be made without hazelnuts. I have made this recipe using cashew nuts but a mixture of cashewnut and peanut or using almonds instead of cashews will work as well. There are two important grinding steps, the first grinding is the sugar and cocoa powder, these need to be as fine as possible. This will create the smooth finish of nutella, the next grinding is that of the roasted cashew nuts, in this case we want to grind in pulses till the oil oozes out from the cashews and it has turned into a paste. If we rush through any of these steps the final product will have a gritty texture. Scrape the sides of the mixer and grind it in pulses for about 20 times.\n#nutella #HomemadeNutella #NutellaRecipe\n\nI have used unsweetened dutch processed cocoa in this recipe, this creates a mellow taste and has a dark color. Homemade nutella can easily prepared at fraction of the cost and if cocoa powder is not available, we can use 100g of bar chocolate as an alternative.\n\nFriends, please do try this nutella recipe at home and this chocolate spread will be great on bread and will taste absolutely amazing. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below. All the best and happy cooking!"

This empty salna or plain salna can be made just with onions and tomatoes without using any vegetables. This salna is a great combination for dosa, idli or parotta. This is a quick and easy salna to prepare when there are no vegetables in the house and you need a quick kurma. Even though it is called plain salna it is packed with flavor, I have added coconut, cashew for thickening the salna. \n#salna #EmptySalna #PlainSalna\n\nFriends, please do try this empty salna at home and serve it with some parotta or chapathi.

We are only going to use simple ingredients in our home to make this fried rice. The secret to perfect fried rice is in the cooking of rice. If rice is fully cooked then it would loose all its texture and become mushy. Also in this recipe I have added cauliflower / gobi to the fried rice. However we can also substitute the cauliflower with paneer or chicken. \n#friedrice #gobirice #madrassamayal\nFriends, please do try this Gobi fried rice recipe at home and share it with your friends and family.

This variation of macaroons is made from three simple ingredients cashew nuts, sugar and egg whites. The texture of these macaroons is simply amazing with a little bit of crunch, chewiness and finally melts in your mouth. When grinding the nuts make sure to use the pulse mode and grind in short pulses do not over grind the cashew nuts. Also while baking, keep in mind that the macaroons will solidify a little more upon cooling and will be a little on the softer side when taking out of the oven. Also we need to bake them at a low temperature for long time. If the baking temperature is too high, the macaroons will become brown in color.\n#macaroons #macaroonsrecipe #madrassamayal\n\nFriends, please do try these cashew macaroons at home and share it with your friends and family.
