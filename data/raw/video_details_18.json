                "description": "7 cup burfi / 7 cup cake / Seven Cup Burfi is a very popular Diwali Sweet. As the name suggest this Indian Festival Sweet is made from 7 cups of ingredients. This recipe is very simple very easy and very tasty.Traditionally 7 cups burfi is made with 3 cups of sugar but for me that is too sweet so I have reduced to 2 cups of sugar and I have added 1 cup of nuts. The beauty of this 7 cups burfi recipe lies in its taste despite its simplicity. This seven cup cake / burfi is a very easy recipe for beginners.\n\nThe 7 cups are:\n1 cup Besan / Gram flour/ Chickpea flour / Kadalai Maavu\n1 cup Grated Coconut\n2 cups Sugar\n1 cup Milk\n1 cup  Nuts (Almonds,Cashews)\n1 cup Ghee / Clarified Butter\n\nStep 1) Start off with roasting besan flour / chickpea flour I have taken a non stick pan to prevent the burfi from sticking to the bottom and roast it for 3 - 4 min on a low heat. Once u start smelling the sweet aroma of the besan flour it is time for our second cup  \n\nStep 2) Add 1 cup of Grated Coconut and mix it well\n\nStep 3) Followed by coconut add 2 cups of sugar and mix it again\n\nStep 4) Add the fifth cup Milk and mix it well and cook until sugar dissolves completely\n\nStep 5) Now add the 6th cup nuts, I have take one cup of Almonds and Cashews and cut them into very small pieces,Now the mixture will be a little watery but soon it will solidify\n\n\nStep 6) Then add the last cup Ghee / Clarified Butter, gradually add in the Ghee and incorporate all the ghee into the mixture and cook for 10- 15 minutes on a medium heat\nConsistency is very important, if is it not at the right consistency then the burfi will be chewy and will be more like a fudge and will also take lot of time to set\n\nStep 7) Now it has thickened and started to leave the sides of the pan.\n\nStep 8) Once it starts leaving the sides of the pan or kadai , pour it into a greased plate or tray. With a help of a spoon Smoothen its top. Leave it to cool slightly,it just took 4 minutes for me to set(if it is not at right consistency then it will take more time) Once the mixture cools down slightly cut it into your desired shapes\n\nOur Delicious 7 cup Burfi is ready!!! Its Festival season, Lets have fun :) Happy Cooking :)\n\nFor Detailed Recipe Visit :-\nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/2016/07/7-cup-burfi.html\n\nFollow us on Facebook:-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/madrassamayal/",

                    "description": "Today we will see how to make Butter Murukku / Mullu Murukku in Tamil. This is an easy to make festival snack recipe for diwali. This butter murukku is also an excellent combination for tea or coffee.  These murukkus along with a cup of tea / coffee can completely reinvigorate everyone at evenings. \nSince we are adding butter to this murukku dough the texture will not be too hard. It will be crispy to bite but still melt in our mouths.\n\nNote :- To make perfect murukkus, make sure the dough is firm and at the right consistency. Also the oil for frying the murukku should be at medium heat. If it is too hot the outer surface of murukku will brown before the interior cooks. If temperature is too low then the mullu murukku will absorb a lot of oil.\n\nMake this easy and tasty butter murukku and surprise your friends and family.\n\nFor detailed Butter murukku recipe please visit:\nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/2016/07/butter-murukku-butter-chakli-recipe.html"

There are two variants of mysore pak the hard version and the soft ghee version, today we are going to see how to make the ghee version which is going to melt in your mouth. \n\nMysore pak might be a tricky recipe but the ingredients are very simple, you need equal quantities of besan flour, ghee and sugar. Here I have taken \n1 cup besan\n1 cup ghee + 1/2 cup\n1 cup sugar\n1/4 cup water\n\n1) Roast the besan flour in a pan till the raw smell of the besan is gone and is replaced by a sweet aromatic smell. \n\n2) Melt 1 cup of ghee and slowly add the besan flour and mix vigorously to ensure that there are no lumps. \n\n3)In another pan melt 1 cup of sugar with 1/4 cup of water and keep stirring till you achieve a 1-string consistency.\n \n4)Gradually add the ghee-besan mixture into the sugar syrup. \n\n5) The mixture will  thicken and will soon start setting.\n\n6)Transfer to a greased plate and allow to cool.\n\n7) Cut it into desired shapes.\n\nFor the recipe in english:-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVPZJHiyWaM\nFollow us on Face Book:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/madrassamayal/",

                    "description": "Mysore pak is a famous sweet in South India and is the essential sweet in the sweet boxes distributed during holidays. There are two variants of mysore pak the hard version and the soft ghee version, today we are going to see how to make the ghee version which is going to melt in your mouth. \n\nMysore pak might be a tricky recipe but the ingredients are very simple, you need equal quantities of besan flour, ghee and sugar. Here I have taken \n1 cup besan\n1 cup ghee + 1/2 cup\n1 cup sugar\n1/4 cup water\n\n1) Roast the besan flour in a pan till the raw smell of the besan is gone and is replaced by a sweet aromatic smell. \n\n2) Melt 1 cup of ghee and slowly add the besan flour and mix vigorously to ensure that there are no lumps. \n\n3)In another pan melt 1 cup of sugar with 1/4 cup of water and keep stirring till you achieve a 1-string consistency.\n \n4)Gradually add the ghee-besan mixture into the sugar syrup. \n\n5) The mixture will  thicken and will soon start setting.\n\n6)Transfer to a greased plate and allow to cool.\n\n7) Cut it into desired shapes.\n\nFor the recipe in english:-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVPZJHiyWaM\nFollow us on Face Book:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/madrassamayal/"

Both India and UK have been claiming to be the birthplace of this recipe but no matter where the dish originated, it certainly deserves a spot on your plate. \nFor making this recipe, first we have to make chicken tikka. Chicken tikka is nothing but small seasoned pieces of chicken cooked on a skewer at high temperature so that all the flavors are locked within the chicken pieces. It can be made on stove top or in a oven or over a grill. \n\nIngredients:\n750g chicken\n\nTo marinate :\n1/2 tsp turmeric powder\n1 tsp cumin powder\n2 tsp coriander powder\n2 tsp chilli powder\n1 tsp ginger garlic paste\n1/2 cup curd\n1 tbsp lemon juice\n2 tbsp oil\n1/2 bell pepper\n1/2 onion\n\nFor Tikka Gravy:\n1 tsp cumin seeds\n1 bay leaf\n3 cardamom\n3 cloves\n1 Large onion\n1 tbsp ginger garlic paste\n2 tomatoes(paste)\n2 tbsp cashew nut paste\n1 cup water\ncoriander leaves for garnishing\nsalt to taste.."
