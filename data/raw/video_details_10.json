These biscuits are made without egg or butter. We can make this chocolate biscuit with ingredients right at home. I have used ghee instead of butter in these biscuits. When baking these biscuits in cooker make sure to spread the salt layer and skip the bottom row of the idli tray. This prevents salt taste in the biscuits. Also use a heavy bottom cooker if that will fit the idli trays because the heavier pans will have even heating.\n\n#cookerbiscuit #Egglessbiscuit #ChocoChipBiscuits\n\nFriends, please do try this chocolate biscuit recipe at home and share it with your friends and family.

However in this video we are going to see making mozzarella using rennet as well as making mozzarella using vinegar. The most important thing in making mozzarella is the selection of milk. The best milk is the milk fresh from farmers which has not been pasteurized or homogenized. The next best choice is using non-homogenized but pasteurized milk. The worst case is using homogenized and ultra-pasteurized milk (which makes very hard curds leading to paneer).\n\nThe difference is also evident when melting these cheeses, the rennet made cheese melts at low temperatures and is very stretchy, the vinegar made cheese (+non-homogenized milk) does melt but takes a little longer and at a higher temperature however when homogenized milk is used in combination with vinegar it makes paneer. \n\nFriends, hope you found this recipe useful.

Bread samosa is a quick and easy recipe in which we are going to use bread instead of sheets to make the samosa. When frying the bread samosa, the oil has to be hot, if not the samosas will soak up a lot of oil. If the oil temperature is right, it creates a beautiful golden brown, crispy samosas. \n#BreadSamosa #BreadSamosaInTamil \n\nFriends, please do try this bread samosa recipe at home and share it with your friends and family.
