These oreo biscuits are made with a handful of ingredients, we don't have to use any artificial colors or flavors.  Immediately when the cookies are baked and out of the oven, they might seem a little soft but after a short while, they firm up and become crispy. In the butter cream, I have used vanilla flavor and this ratio of butter in the cream holds up well. I have used dutch processed cocoa powder in this recipe, this cocoa powder adds a natural dark color to the biscuits. We can also use regular cocoa powder but then the color would be a little milder.\n\nFriends, please do try these oreo biscuits at home and surprise your friends and family with these homemade oreos.

These oreo biscuits are made with a handful of ingredients, we don't have to use any artificial colors or flavors.  Immediately when the cookies are baked and out of the oven, they might seem a little soft but after a short while, they firm up and become crispy. In the butter cream, I have used vanilla flavor and this ratio of butter in the cream holds up well. I have used dutch processed cocoa powder in this recipe, this cocoa powder adds a natural dark color to the biscuits. We can also use regular cocoa powder but then the color would be a little milder.\n\nFriends, please do try these oreo biscuits at home and surprise your friends and family with these homemade oreos. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below. All the best and happy cooking!\n\nFor detailed oreo biscuit recipe along with the list of ingredients please visit\nhttps://www.steffisrecipes.com/2019/04/oreo-biscuit.html"

This bread sandwich is loaded with lot of veggies and a perfect sandwich starts with a crispy outer bread layer. We don't want the bread to get soggy and so cook the vegetables well enough to get rid of the moisture. Also when cooking the sandwich use a heavy object to press on the sandwich while it is being cooked. This compresses the vegetable layer in the sandwich and also makes the bread crispy. I have also added some corn to the lunch box, this adds a colorful component to the meal and offers a contrasting taste and texture in the meal. Also add a serving of fruit along with the meal.\n\nBanana Cupcake Recipe :- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgPywpFEaDs\n\nFriends, please do try this lunch box recipe at home. Adding a variety of foods as portions of the meal helps in balancing the diet and also keeps us excited about the food. Please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below.

This murukku is made purely with rice flour so it is really crispy. This makes this snack recipe ideal for evenings and is a great combination with tea / coffee. \nThe temperature of the cooking oil is very critical for the murukku. If the oil temperature is too low then the murukku will absorb a lot of oil and if the temperature is too high then the outside gets browned too soon before the inside gets cooked.
