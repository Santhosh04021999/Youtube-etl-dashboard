Once all the masala is added and the kulambu comes together we will add fish at the end and bring to a boil. We have to make sure not to overcook the fish. After the cooking process is done, cover the lid and let the fish kulambu rest for some time. This makes the fish soak up more flavor from the masala and the kulambu also gets more tastier. In fact, we used to say that the fish kulambu from a day before tastes better than the freshly made kulambu.\n#meenkulambu #fishkulambu #meenkuzhambu \n\nFriends, please do try this meen kulambu recipe at home and share it with your friends and family.
