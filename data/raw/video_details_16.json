                "description": "In this video we will see how to make garam masala powder at home. This is the biryani masala powder that gives the wonderful smell and flavor to biryani. Apart from biryani this garam masala powder is used any many recipes from the Indian cuisine. I like to make small batches like the one shown in the video because the flavor and smell will deteriorate with time and so we don't want to make a huge batch of masala powder. Also I have used less coriander powder in this recipe because using too much coriander powder will impart a bitter taste to the recipe. So depending on the recipe, we can add coriander powder or coriander seeds separately. The same goes for chilli powder, that also needs to be added according to the taste preferences. So finally this is a flavor pack of super aromatic spices and this garam masala can transform any ordinary dish into a restaurant quality food.\n\nFriends, I hope you try this recipe and make your own garam masala powder at home. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below. All the best and happy cooking !!\n\nFor detailed Garam Masala Recipe please visit\nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/2017/05/garam-masala-powder-recipe.html",

The dough should be kneaded well for at least 5 mins and then rested for at least 30 mins. This resting of dough is very important as it helps in the formation of gluten which makes the batter very soft and chewy rather than being hard and stiff. For the chapati to be soft they have to puff up while cooking this forces air into the layers and gets cooked rapidly also separation of the layers gives the soft feel to the chapati while chewing. \n\nFriends please do try this method of making soft and fluffy chapatis at home.

The dough should be kneaded well for at least 5 mins and then rested for at least 30 mins. This resting of dough is very important as it helps in the formation of gluten which makes the batter very soft and chewy rather than being hard and stiff. For the chapati to be soft they have to puff up while cooking this forces air into the layers and gets cooked rapidly also separation of the layers gives the soft feel to the chapati while chewing. \n\nFriends please do try this method of making soft and fluffy chapatis at home.

Usually for perfect dosas we use 1 : 4 (1 cup of ulunthu for 4 cups of rice) however this ratio depends on the type of rice being used. If the grains of rice are fatter (more starch content ) then this ratio would work. If the rice grains are thinner you can try 1:3 ratio (1 cup of ulunthu for 3 cups of rice). Once a ratio is finalized for a particular brand of rice we can get perfect results after that. \nFor making idlis, the batter should not be fermented much so I usually make idlis during the first 2 days of making the batter. On day 3 the batter would have fermented sufficiently for making crispy dosas. Nonstick pans are easier to spread the dosa batter but the real taste and caramelized color of dosa can be achieved only in cast iron pans.\n\nFriends now we can enjoy soft and spongy idlis and crispy dosas all made from our homemade batter.

This Channa Masala recipe is very easy to make and Channa Masala gravy is an ideal side dish for chapathi. For this gravy we need to soak the konda kadalai (chick peas) for 8 hours prior to start of the recipe. This soaking helps the chickpeas to cook easily. This channa masala can also be served with chapathi, poori, roti, parotta etc. In order to thicken the gravy I smashed some of the chickpeas and added them back to the gravy this thickens it. Also to obtain a smooth texture I ground the onions and tomatoes after sauteing them. But this is optional and you can proceed with the recipe without grinding it. \n\nFriends please do try this awesome Channa masala gravy at home and serve it with some soft chapathi.

Medu Vada Recipe / Ulundu Vadai Recipe is very easy to make once you get the right consistency of the batter. Medu vada is served as a snack along with some tea / coffee. Medu vada is a perfect companion to many South Indian breaffast recipes like idli, dosa, pongal and is also made into sambar vada, dahi vada etc. In some shops they add rice flour to add crispiness to the vada (also rice flour is much cheaper than ulunthu) but I think it is not necessary. The most  important part of making the batter is grinding it without adding much water. We need to get a fluffy batter consistency which creates a much lighter, airy vada. If you desire extra crispiness you can add some rice flour. \n\nFriends there is nothing more exciting than serving freshly fried vada right from the kitchen.

I like my paruppu urundais a little soft so in this recipe I am going to steam them but this step can absolutely be modified to your taste preference. You can add some urundai mixture at the end of the recipe and this will thicken up the curry. IF at the end of the recipe you notice some sourness balance the taste by adding a small bit of jaggery.

Ennai Kathirikai / Eggplant gravy / Brinjal Curry is an excellent side dish for biryani and it also goes well with rice. This brinjal curry can also be served with chapathi/naan. This is the best curry you can make from Kathrikai (brinjal) and it is spicy and compliments the taste of biryani. For this kara kulambu I have taken smaller size brinjals because they work very well for this recipe. You can add a small piece of jaggery to the kulambu to balance the taste. This curry will definitely make you start cravy for kathrikkai forever.\n\nFriends please do try this Ennai kathirikai kara kulambu at home and enjoy it with some biryani / rice. And please post your feedback about the recipe in the comments below.\n\nFor detailed Ennai Kathirikai Kulambu Recipe please visit\nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/2017/01/ennai-kathirikai-kulambu.html"

Ghee ( Nei in Tamil) is added in sweets because it has a nutty flavor and this is introduced by the slow heat applied to butter. The sugars in the butter start caramelizing and results in a golden colored clarified butter. Some people might stop the process early but this results in a less flavorful version of ghee so please continue the cooking until you get a good color. There will be some sediments formed at the bottom of the pan. They are the remains of caramelization and they can be removed in the filtration step. Now our butter is clarified a.k.a Ghee. Homemade ghee is more flavorful than store bought ones because we can heat it longer and develop much stronger flavor while in stores they will try to sell at maximum possible volume. Ghee can be stored at room temperature.\n \nThe flavoring of ghee can be done by adding some curry leaves or murungai keerai. Both of them add a nice aroma to our homemade ghee.\n\nFor detailed recipe on how to make ghee please visit\nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/2016/10/homemade-ghee-recipe-clarified-butter.html",
