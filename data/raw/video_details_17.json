Karuvadu / Dry fish is one of the popular seafood recipes which is not often in many fancy restaurants because of its strong aroma. But those who have enjoyed this krauvadu kulambu know that the taste is quite extraordinary. The limited availability of good quality karuvadu and the much lower appearance on restaurant menus have rendered it an exotic delicacy. \nSalt is usually added to the fish while drying so when making this gravy we have to take into account the salt content in the fish. It is always better to add little to no salt at the beginning and when the kuzhambu is almost ready then check the salt content and add accordingly. If there is too much salt then we fix the problem by adding some large  chunks of potatoes which can absorb the salt. \n\nFriends, please give this Karuvadu kulambu a try and let me know your feedback in the comments below. All the best and happy cooking !\n\nFor detailed karuvadu kulambu recipe please visit\nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/2016/11/karuvattu-kulambu-recipe.html",

                    "description": "In this video we will how to make karuvadu kulambu in Tamil. Karuvadu / Dry fish is one of the popular seafood recipes which is not often in many fancy restaurants because of its strong aroma. But those who have enjoyed this krauvadu kulambu know that the taste is quite extraordinary. The limited availability of good quality karuvadu and the much lower appearance on restaurant menus have rendered it an exotic delicacy. \nSalt is usually added to the fish while drying so when making this gravy we have to take into account the salt content in the fish. It is always better to add little to no salt at the beginning and when the kuzhambu is almost ready then check the salt content and add accordingly. If there is too much salt then we fix the problem by adding some large  chunks of potatoes which can absorb the salt. \n\nFriends, please give this Karuvadu kulambu a try and let me know your feedback in the comments below. All the best and happy cooking !\n\nFor detailed karuvadu kulambu recipe please visit\nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/2016/11/karuvattu-kulambu-recipe.html"

There are two variants of poli, paruppu poli and thengai poli. In this recipe we are going to use a coconut-jaggery filling inside the soft dough. The coconut version of poli is very famous in the southern parts of Tamil Nadu and in Kerala. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that since we are adding coconut to this recipe we have to finish the poli within 2 days. But in my experience the polis always get finished up in the same evening. But you can refrigerate leftovers if you have any. \n\nPoli is a perfect snack for those evening when we would like something sweet. It is quick easy and and it is a fun filled snack.

In this recipe we are going to make the fish curry in a mud vessel as many believe that making meen kuzhambu in a mud pot will enhance the taste of the fish curry. In this nethili meen kulambu we are going to raw mangoes(manga) to add sourness to the fish gravy. Nethili meen curry (anchovy fish curry) is a delicate recipe because Nethili (anchovies) are small and delicate fish with a mild flavor hence we have to add fish at the end of the recipe and only boil it for 5-6 mins or else the fish will break. \n\nFor Detailed Nethili Meen Kulambu Recipe please visit: \nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/2016/08/anchovy-fish-curry-nethili-meen-kulambu.html"

I prepared this mint rice by harvesting fresh mint leaves from my garden and since the pudina leaves already have plenty of aroma and flavor we don't have to add the traditional Tamil Nadu Spices. I just added a few green chillies and tamarind made a paste out of it. This paste can be used to create our Pudina Rice. Enjoy this variety rice with vadakam or appalam. \nIngredients:\n2 Cup Cooked Rice(Basmati Rice)\n2 cup Mint Leaves\n1  small ball of tamarind\n2\" Ginger\n2 Green Chilies\n1 Tbsp Oil\n1/4 tsp Mustard Seeds      \n1 tsp Urad Dal (Skinless Black gram)\n2  Dry Red Chilies\n15-20 Cashew nuts      \nSalt to taste\n\nFor Detailed Pudina Rice Recipe: http://www.steffisrecipes.com/2016/08/mint-rice-pudina-rice.html"

Biryani can be made in several methods such as hyderabadi style, pressure cooker method, one pot biryani etc.  Making chicken biryani in pressure cooker is a very easy method of making biryani because it guarantees that the chicken will be cooked perfectly. Once the chicken is about 50% cooked we will add rice to the pressure cooker and cook it for 1 whistle and then turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release slowly. In this way, the rice soaks up all the flavor from the chicken and the pressure cooker does a good job of infusing the flavor throughout the biryani. In this homemade chicken biryani recipe we are going to use fresh biryani masala which is from the Chettinad Cuisine. This Chettinad masala adds a ton of flavor to this biryani recipe. After trying this Chicken Biryani Recipe you will never order biryani in any hotel because we can make delicious chicken biryani right at  home.\n\nFor the Chicken Biryani Masala:\n   1 bay leaf\n   1  tsp fennel seeds\n   2 tsp coriander seeds\n   1 mace\n   1 start anise\n   1 inch cinnamon stick\n   \u00bd tsp pepper \n   3 Green cardamom  \n   4 cloves\n   1 tsp cumin seeds \nIngredients for making Chicken Biryani in Pressure Cooker :\n   2 Tbsp Oil\n   2 Tbsp Ghee/ Clarified Butter\n   2 Bay leaves\n   3 Cloves\n   3 Cradamom\n   1 onion(250g)\n   1 tbsp Ginger paste\n   1 tbsp Garlic paste\n   1/2 tsp turmeric powder\n   1-2 Tbsp Chili powder\n   1 tomato (150g)\n   Mint leaves\n   Coriander leaves\n   1/2 cup Yogurt / Curd\n   500g Chicken\n   2 cups Basmati Rice\n   3 cups of water\n   Salt to taste\n\nPlease try this Chicken biryani in pressure cooker at home and spread the taste of Tamil Nadu.\nFor detailed recipe please visit\nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/2016/08/chettinad-chicken-biryani-in-pressure.html",

Unlike the Onion Tomato Chutney which has both onions and tomatoes in it. This Onion chutney without tomato can be used for chapathi as well as popular snacks like bajji. Evem though both big and small onions(shallots) can be used for the recipe. The chutney gets the maximum taste when shallots ( Chinna Vengayam ) is used. The oil extracts all the flavors from the onion and together with chillis and tamarind, this chutney packs a punch. The tamarind is used in this recipe to add sourness to the chutney and the quantity can be adjusted to the taste preference.

                "description": "Vatha Kuzhambu / Vatha Kulambu is a popular gravy for rice served all over South India in a traditional meal setting. The Vatha Kuzhambu is made from Sundakkai Vathal which is called as Turkey Berry in other parts of the world. The addition of this sundakkai vathal adds a unique tangy taste to the Sundakkai Vathal Kulambu. This kulambu is often served in meals right after paruppu kulambu before the round for sambar rice. \nVatha Kulambu is also called Vathal Puli Kulambu because the tamarind extract(puli) is slowly simmered over a low flame and in the mean time the gravy extracts the flavors from the added vathal. Thus we end up with a concentrated tasty gravy for our rice.\nI have used sundakkai for my vatha kulambu but you can use other types of vathal such as manathakkali vathal, vendakkai vathal, milagu vathal etc. Each of these ingredients will add a unique taste to the kulambu. Sundakkai also has a lot of health and medicinal benefits and therefore makes this recipe healthier. \n\nFor Poondu Kulambu Recipe in Tamil :-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C0tCJ8jEI4\n\nFor Pattani Kurma Recipe in Tamil :-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k3bp-6e324\n\nFor Konda Kadala Kulambu Recipe in Tamil :-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmono5-lDDw\n\nFor more such recipes with detailed ingredients and instructions please visit http://www.steffisrecipes.com/2016/08/vatha-kuzhambu-recipe.html",
