This recipe is similar to that of Tirunelveli halwa but this halwa is made from godhumai maavu / wheat flour instead of using whole samba wheat. This wheat flour halwa only requires a 3 hour soaking period compared to the overnight soaking required for Tirunelveli halwa.\nThis halwa takes a long time to make, I have clearly shown the stages in formation of this halwa. If we speed up the process by increasing the temperature, the halwa will get burnt or the raw smell of wheat flour won't be eliminated by fully cooking it. So we have to cook it slowly in a medium heat. So prefer to add food coloring but if you caramelize the sugar and add it in the recipe the halwa will get a beautiful and natural color.\n\nFriends, please do try this godhumai halwa at home.

After frying the bread develops this golden brown crunchy texture. The chicken stuffing can be replaced with the stuffing of your choice from vegetables, paneer, egg or meat. Serve these hot bread rolls with some ketchup or chutney.\n\nFor mincing the chicken, I have used a knife to chop it into small pieces instead of using a electric food processor because I like some texture in the bread roll. But the choice of mincing is your call. \n\nTips to prevent excess oil absorption.\n1) Roll the bread into thin layer this will close out the air pockets in the bread and prevent oil from seeping inside.\n\n2) The oil temperature should be medium high. If the temperature is too low then the bread will soak up too much oil. If its too high then the outer surface will get burnt very quickly.\n\n3) Don't fry too many pieces at once. If multiple rolls are added to a small frying pan, the oil temperature will drop which causes soggy rolls.\n\nFriends please do try this Chicken bread roll at home and share it with your friends and family.

                "description": "In this video we will see how to make Bourbon biscuit recipe in Tamil. This biscuit is one of my favorite chocolate cream biscuits. If you can get dutch processed cocoa powder the color of the biscuits will look really nice. Also in this recipe if we use brown sugar instead of white sugar the biscuits will be soft and chewy and will not have that snap. So keep that in mind if you are altering the recipe.\n\nThe sugar quantities I have chosen will create a mildly sweet biscuit which when combined with a sweet chocolate cream filling will be delicious. (This sugar quantity tasted very similar to the original biscuit). If you want to serve the biscuits without the cream layer or if you have a sweet tooth then you can use a little more sugar for the biscuits. \n\nFor making bourbon biscuits without the oven, please follow the instructions on setting up the pressure cooker in this Butter Cookies Recipe video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArhOaPBfoCc\n\nFriends please do try this bourbon biscuit recipe at home and surprise your friends and family. They will sure be amazed at your baking skills. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below.

If you can get dutch processed cocoa powder the color of the biscuits will look really nice. Also in this recipe if we use brown sugar instead of white sugar the biscuits will be soft and chewy and will not have that snap. So keep that in mind if you are altering the recipe.\n\nThe sugar quantities I have chosen will create a mildly sweet biscuit which when combined with a sweet chocolate cream filling will be delicious. (This sugar quantity tasted very similar to the original biscuit). If you want to serve the biscuits without the cream layer or if you have a sweet tooth then you can use a little more sugar for the biscuits. \n\nFor making bourbon biscuits without the oven, please follow the instructions on setting up the pressure cooker in this Butter Cookies Recipe video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArhOaPBfoCc\n\nFriends please do try this bourbon biscuit recipe at home and surprise your friends and family. They will sure be amazed at your baking skills. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below.

I have previously shared the recipes on making gulab jamun from milk powder and from khoya. This is a far more easier approach to make gulab jamuns from bread. This recipe can be made using simple ingredients like bread, milk & sugar. Lemon juice is added to prevent the sugar from crystallizing from the sugar syrup. Both lemon juice and cardamom seeds impart a nice flavoring to the sugar syrup. The bread jamuns are naturally more airy and not dense, so I am not using baking soda in this recipe.\n\nFriends please do try this simple jamun recipe at home and share it with your friends and family. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below. All the best and happy cooking !!\n\nFor detailed bread jamun recipe and the list of ingredients please visit\nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/2018/04/bread-jamun-recipe.html"

Chilli Idli is an Indo-Chinese recipe that captures the fusion of two cuisines. The idlis are cut into small quarters and fried till they are crispy on the surface. I found that the idlies can also be baked in the oven to achieve similar crispiness. This will also minimize the oil used in this recipe. Next prepare the onion and capsicum mixture and coat the fried idlis. Since the idlis are already cooked we don't have to leave them in the spicy mixture for too long. So turn of the heat in 2 minutes. If left for too long then the fried idlis would loose their crispiness.\n\nFriends, please do try this chilli idli recipe at home and enjoy it with your friends and family.

                    "description": "In this video we will see how to make chilli idli recipe in Tamil. Chilli Idlis are enjoyed by kids and they are also an excellent evening snack. Chilli Idli is an Indo-Chinese recipe that captures the fusion of two cuisines. The idlis are cut into small quarters and fried till they are crispy on the surface. I found that the idlies can also be baked in the oven to achieve similar crispiness. This will also minimize the oil used in this recipe. Next prepare the onion and capsicum mixture and coat the fried idlis. Since the idlis are already cooked we don't have to leave them in the spicy mixture for too long. So turn of the heat in 2 minutes. If left for too long then the fried idlis would loose their crispiness.\n\nFriends, please do try this chilli idli recipe at home and enjoy it with your friends and family. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below. All the best and happy cooking !!!\n\nFor more easy and tasty recipes please visit\nwww.steffisrecipes.com"

The secret  behind these soft idlis lies in the proportion of ingredients in the idli batter.

This helps in making the idlis fluffy. Also avoid steaming the idlis for too long as it can also cause them to dry out and form a thick layer on the surface.\n\nFriends please do try this ratio at home for making idlis and you will get soft and fluffy idlis and this will rejuvenate everyone's interest in this breakfast recipe.

                "description": "In this video we will see how to make rava dosa recipe in tamil. This is a crispy rava dosa recipe which can be used to make instant rava dosas. The fermentation time for this dosa batter is only 20 mins. The batter uses a combination of rava(Sooji) and rice flour. The main step in making thin and crispy rava dosas is to make sure that the batter is very thin. If you think the batter is watery enough still add more water. Only if the battery is too watery the holes will be formed in the dosa after the water boils off. Also mix the batter thoroughly to make it uniform between before poring the batter on to a hot tawa. Cast Iron pans work brilliantly, they give that authentic crispy golden brown color. Non-stick pans will produce dosas with less colour but will be easier to pour and flip.\n\nFriends, this rava dosa can be made instantly and tastes absolutely delicious. Try making these crispy dosas at home and take a break from the traditional dosas. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below.

                "description": "In this video we are going to see how to make English Toffee at home. This English toffee recipe is similar to kadalai mittai recipe and has a taste similar to that of lactoking candy. This candy is called stone halwa, because it tastes similar to halwa but is much harder. This recipe only uses 2 main ingredients, sugar and butter. The trick in getting this candy at the perfect consistency is to check the strings of sugar syrup by dropping them in cold water. AS SOON AS the strings break (i.e. do not form clump at the bottom), the candy is ready to be poured. Heating for longer duration will result in a much harder candy and can also become bitter.\n\nFriends, please do try this exciting recipe at home and surprise your friends and family. Everyone will be surprised as to how you made this delicious mittai at home. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below. All the best and happy cooking!!\n\nFor detailed English toffee recipe please visit\nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/2018/01/english-toffee-recipe.html",

There are two main Pongal recipes Khara Pongal which is ideal for breakfast and sweet pongal which is a dessert. This pongal should ideally be cooked with freshly harvested rice and jaggery. Freshly harvested rice has a lot of moisture on it along with several nutrients and it has a very different taste and mouth feel to it. You should definitely try the recipe that way. \nMy dad loves farming and I used to harvest paddy with a little knife when I visited the fields. I still remember those lovely days every time I make this recipe.\n\nFriends, please do celebrate this pongal holidays with the sweet pongal and always cherish the farmers who are responsible for providing the ingredients in making this recipe.

There are two main Pongal recipes Khara Pongal which is ideal for breakfast and sweet pongal which is a dessert. This pongal should ideally be cooked with freshly harvested rice and jaggery. Freshly harvested rice has a lot of moisture on it along with several nutrients and it has a very different taste and mouth feel to it. You should definitely try the recipe that way. \nMy dad loves farming and I used to harvest paddy with a little knife when I visited the fields. I still remember those lovely days every time I make this recipe.\n\nFriends, please do celebrate this pongal holidays with the sweet pongal and always cherish the farmers who are responsible for providing the ingredients in making this recipe. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below.\n\nFor detailed pongal recipe along with ingredients please visit\nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/2018/01/sweet-pongal-recipe-sarkarai-pongal.html"

                "description": "In this video we will see how to make fruit custard recipe in Tamil. This fruit salad with custard is made using custard powder. The custard can also be made using eggs but this is the eggless version. You can add any fruits of your choice but let them set for a couple of hours in the refrigerator to fully set and for the flavors to blend. Also keep in mind the custard will thicken some more after it is cooled so keep that in mind while thickening it by heat. I like to use some crisp fruits because they impart a good texture to the recipe.\n\nFruit custard is an excellent dessert recipe which completes a good meal. This is easy to put together and is quite enjoyable. Please do try this recipe and serve it chilled. Also please do share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below. All the best and happy cooking.\n\nFor detailed fruit custard recipe please visit\nhttp://www.steffisrecipes.com/2017/05/fruit-custard-recipe.html",
